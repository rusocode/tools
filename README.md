This repository is a collection of practical examples and experiments in Java, accumulated by the author over the years. 
It covers the fundamental pillars of programming and uses various tools from the Java API. Shared publicly, it functions 
as a personal "toolbox" to consult and solve problems or implement new functionalities, thus avoiding reinventing 
solutions in each project. It serves both as a personal resource and as a useful reference for other developers.
